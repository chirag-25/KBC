# Kaun Banega Crorepati Game (KBC)

Welcome to the thrilling world of Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC)! This repository houses the code for an exciting game that closely mirrors the famous Indian television show, KBC. Prepare yourself for a series of challenging general knowledge questions, where your correct answers will propel you towards the ultimate goal of becoming a Crorepati!

## Lifelines
The KBC game unfolds in three levels: Easy, Intermediate, and Hard. To ascend to a higher level, you must answer seven consecutive questions correctly. As you progress, the prize money increases tenfold, making your journey even more rewarding. Just like the actual KBC, you'll have access to lifelines that can be your saviors:
1. Easy Level: **Audience Poll** (reveals the percentage of correctness for each option) and **5050** (eliminates two incorrect options).
2. Intermediate Level: **Change the Question** (gives you a new question to tackle).
3. Hard Level: **Double Dip** (allows you to choose two options) and **Power Paplu** (lets you reuse any of the three lifelines from the previous levels).

## How to Play
Playing KBC is a breeze:
1. A question will be displayed before you. Your task is to select one of the options from 'a' to 'd' (in any case).
2. If your choice is correct, you'll swiftly move on to the next question, inching closer to your Crorepati dream.
3. Need a lifeline? No worries! Type the lifeline keyword, and a list of available lifelines will appear. Simply type your desired lifeline to use it strategically.

Get ready for an exhilarating KBC experience, and may your knowledge and intuition guide you to victory!

**Happy Playing!!**
